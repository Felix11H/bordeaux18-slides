  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.6cm]
    \itemsep11pt
    \item[$\mathbf{R^1}$ \textit{Re-runnable}:] can be run again when needed (e.g.~more than the one time that was needed to produce the results)

    \item[$\mathbf{R^2}$ \textit{Repeatable}:] program is deterministic, produces repeatable output

    \item[$\mathbf{R^3}$ \textit{Reproducible}:] another researcher can take code \& input data, execute code, and re-obtain same results

    \item[$\mathbf{R^4}$ \textit{Reusable}:] program  can be easily used, and
modified, by you and other people, inside \& outside own lab

    \item[$\mathbf{R^5}$ \textit{Replicable}:] program can be re-implemented by another research to re-obtain results

  \end{itemize}
