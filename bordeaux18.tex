% pre-Intro: About me - what qualifies me to tell you
% anything about reproducibility/open science.
% Who am I to talk?
\include{frames/about_me}

% I'm not the only caring about reproducibility...
\include{frames/reproducibility_crisis}

% Computational reproducibility shouldn't be hard - right?
\include{frames/experimental_vs_computational}

% In experience, researchers don't like to share code.
% So how well does it work when researchers are
% obligated to share?
\include{frames/code_sharing}

% but in Neuroscience very positive movement!
\include{frames/open_source_neuroscience}

% It's not great, but especially in neuroscience there
% is a positive trend. With more and more code being
% available soon, computational reproducibility
% shouldn't be a problem, yes?
\include{frames/code_reproducibility}

% If I'm talking the talk, I have to walk the walk.
% How can I achieve reproducibility in my research
% project I'm trying to publish?

% Wikimedia fellowship helped!
