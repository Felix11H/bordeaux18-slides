% pre-Intro: About me - what qualifies me to tell you
% anything about reproducibility/open science. Whom am
% I to talk?
\include{frames/about_me}


% Intro: Why we (might) need to do things differently
% from our supervisors/how it's been done until now
% reproducibility crisis everywhere !!
\include{frames/reproducibility_crisis}


% So let's talk about code. Probably all of us are working
% with code, even if it's just a simple MATLAB script.
%
% What does reproducibility for these computational parts
% look like?
% 
% Naively, reproducibility shouldn't be a problem at all for code,
% right?
%
% 1. everyone has a computer (as opposed to a lab setup) and
%    running code is inexpensive and unproblematic compared
%    to replicating experiment
% 2. can share all the code (~5MB) opposed to sharing a full
%    lab (impossible)
% 
% So where's reproducibility in the computational sciences at?
% Well, it's not looking great.
%
% Many of you probably know from personal experience that this
% that this naive thinking does not apply, but let's look at
% how bad it really is:
%
% Problems:
% ---> study from Stodden and Collberg
\include{frames/reproducibility_in_compsci}



% So what's there to do?
% ---> Be open, be reproducible (in that order)
% many people are already doing it?
% ---> open source for Neuroscience (idea: highlight
% researchers from Bordeaux/Frankfurt?)
\include{frames/open_source_neuroscience}


% Next, we need reproducibility! What is even
% reproducible? Does open==reproducible?
% So what does code need to look like in practice?
% --> Rougier's five Rs
\include{frames/5R_reproducibility}


% Is this at all possible to implement?  Does it
% really work? Yes! I think. Here's an example
% how things can be done --> My project
\include{frames/wikimedia_project}


% A few tips in practice:

% -- [1] upload to Zenodo, OSF.io, ---> DOI
% -- [2] use random seeds and makefile to regenerate results
% -- [3] document versions of code (toolboxes), (pip freeze, MATLAB versions)
% -- [4] provide dependencies (Docker, Singularity, Virtual Machine,...)
% -- [5] document more closely parameters, input/output, ...
\include{frames/in_practice}



% So what can I take out of this talk? Give some rules
% and guide lines to follow (other resources)?
