% pre-Intro: About me - what qualifies me to tell you
% anything about reproducibility/open science. Whom am
% I to talk?
\include{frames/about_me}

% Intro: Why we (might) need to do things differently
% from our supervisors/how it's been done until now
\include{frames/reproducibility_crisis}

% So what can we do? -> A call for open source in
% neuroscience
\include{frames/open_source_neuroscience}

% But what does this mean? Does open == reproducible?
% What do we need to do to make our code reproducible?
% --> Rougier's five Rs
\include{frames/what_open_and_reproducible_means}

% Does it really work? Yes! I think. Here's an example
% how things can be done --> My project
\include{frames/wikimedia_project}


% So what can I take out of this talk? Give some rules
% and guide lines to follow (other resources)?
